This is my final project: A program which takes a users address and destination and exports a map with the route prealigned, I used OSMNX,MAtplot and datetime,timezone finder to help wit this project. I used much of the documentation from OSMNX which uses OSM as a resource, I also relied on github for 
documentation as well as the OSMNX site. I also used the python site itself as well as a youtube video. I did not use A.I and only used the TRYExcept functions due to the utility
I failed in my goal to export the time, and hours but left the code.
